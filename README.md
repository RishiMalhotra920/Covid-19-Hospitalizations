# Covid-19-Hospitalizations
Predicting future COVID-19 hospitalizations based on past hospitalization rates. This was my final project for CS 4780, Intro to Machine Learning. 

There are 2 parts to this project
1. Predicting whether Covid-19 Hospitalizations will increase the next day. (Baseline required)
2. Predicting the number of Covid-19 Hospitalizations the next day. (Competition)

Models used for the 2 parts:
1. Neural Networks, Decision Trees + AdaBoost (Accuracy: 0.75699)
2. Neural Networks (Mean squared error: 91809)

We passed the baseline score on the first task and secured **8th place** on the Kaggle leaderboard for the competition task.

Engineering a time-weighted average feature and neural network hyperparameter tuning allowed us to secure a good rank on the leaderboard.
